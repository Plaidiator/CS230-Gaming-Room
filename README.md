# CS230-Gaming-Room

For this project, the client The Gaming Room wanted to expand their game to more platforms. I created a report which included a UML diagram of the software and analysis of multiple development requirements and possible solutions for the client to review. I then made decisions for development with explanations for the client to read before beginning development. I think the analysis is very thorough with concise pros and cons of each development decision. All of the work that went in to this made the programming end of the project very simple as all possible issues had already been thought through. While going through issues and analyzing requirements, my main focus was how it would affect the specific end product. All decisions were made with optimal performance of the "Draw It or Lose It" game in mind.
